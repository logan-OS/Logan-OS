The main message of the mountain is relationship, relationships have 3 parts including trust, respect, and communication. There are not only positive relationships, but there are also negative relationships. In negative relationships there are gold diggers, contract relationships, ect. In a relationship, not only can the two change the course of the relationship but friends can too. By brainwashing one party to cause dissatisfaction against the two.
Positive relationships as said before include the three aspects: trust, respect, and communication. In order to stay in a positive relationship you need to trust the other parties by not checking their location every time and being controlling. Also by respecting each other's boundaries will help continue a positive relationship. Lastly, communicating, you need to communicate to each other to understand, if there is a problem you need to communicate to each other to solve it.
Negative relationships like cheating, being a gold digger, or controlling the other party. By cheating behind the back of another it will cause the loss of the trust to each other and causing the downfall of a healthy relationship. Being a gold digger taking away the other party's money while the other party might not notice, others will and talk him out of it. Lastly, controlling the other party's movement lacks respect and also trust because always checking the location means you don't trust the other party, and not giving any privacy.
