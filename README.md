## 🔋 Status Check
* **Current Mood:** Frustrated (Robbed of a win)
* **Highlight of the Week:** Beating MAK in the semi-finals with back-to-back 3-pointers. Pure clutch.
* **Bug of the Week:** The Referee in the final game against MAT. Total NPC behavior.

## 🧠 Brain Dump (Tournament Recap)
* **The Setup:** Jan 24th was the TES Basketball Tournament. We fought hard to get to the finals.
* **The Victory:** We took down MAK thanks to two massive 3-pointers in a row.
* **The Boss Fight:** The final against MAT was intense. We held a 1-point difference for a long time.
* **The "Glitch":** In the last minute, the ref blew the whistle for a foul we didn't commit. Our coach got up to argue, but the ref wouldn't budge.
* **The Result:** They got three free throws, making it a 4-point gap with only 16 seconds left on the clock. It was impossible to recover. We lost in despair, but it wasn't a skill issue—it was a rigged call.

## 🔍 Self-Discovery (Who is Logan?)
* **AI Observation:** You handle "fair" losses okay, but you hate injustice. When the rules (the ref) fail you, it feels worse than just missing a shot. You value a fair playing field.

## 🚀 Next Mission
* Recover from the tournament loss and reset mental stats for next week.
