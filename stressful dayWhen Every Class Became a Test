I had four assessments in one day, and every single class was a test. There was no break to relax or reset my mind. As soon as one test ended, another one began. My brain felt tired before lunchtime.

One of the tests was the worst. It was worth 75% of my final grade. When the teacher said that, my heart dropped. I tried to stay calm and focus, but the questions were long and difficult. I kept checking the time, and it felt like it was moving too fast.

I worked as quickly as I could, but in the end, I didn’t finish all the questions. When the teacher said “pens down,” I still had answers in my head that I didn’t get to write. I felt frustrated and disappointed, knowing how much that test mattered.

By the end of the day, I wasn’t just tired—I was emotionally drained. It felt unfair to be tested so much in one day, but all I could do was walk out of the classroom and hope that my effort would still count.
