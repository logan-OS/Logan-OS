# 🗓️ Field Report: The Shilin Protocol
**Date:** January 11, 2026

## 🔋 Status Check
* **Current Mood:** Reflective.
* **Highlight of the Week:** Analyzing the Shilin Official Residence through the lens of global sustainability.
* **Bug of the Week:** Realizing how easily history can be ignored if we aren't intentional about it.

## 🧠 Brain Dump (Mission Data)
* **Target Location:** Shilin Official Residence (CKS's home, 1950-1975).
* **SDG Analysis:**
    * **SDG 3 (Health):** The gardens and flowers aren't just decor; they contribute to mental health and biodiversity.
    * **SDG 4 (Education):** "Those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it." We analyzed CKS's decisions to shape a better future.
    * **SDG 9 & 10:** Studied how the Constitution and infrastructure development reduced inequality and built modern systems.
    * **SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities):** Connected the Fire Station visit to community safety and resilience.

## 🔍 Self-Discovery (Who is Logan?)
* **AI Observation:** I realized I value "intentionality." I don't just see "old stuff"; I see legacy and human effort. I have a "Guardian" trait—protecting value from being forgotten.
